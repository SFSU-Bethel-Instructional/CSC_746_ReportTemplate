%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is
%% in the conference process. ``review'' and ``widereview'' are for review
%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier. Further, ``electronic'' includes
%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Figures should be in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour 
%% shifting may occur during the printing process.

%% These few lines make a distinction between latex and pdflatex calls and they

%% \includegraphics{diamondrule} is completely sufficient.

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
The abstract should describe the basic message of the paper, including: the problem, why your solution should be of interest, some notion that your solution is effective, and a teaser about how it has been evaluated. Cover all of this using between 75 and 150 words. Thus, the abstract is the hardest part to write. Sometimes I try to write it first, but the final version is usually composed of items drawn from the introduction, and then condensed, as the last step of writing the paper.
