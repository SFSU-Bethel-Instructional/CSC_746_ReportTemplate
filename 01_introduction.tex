\section{Introduction}

The problem we have solved
\begin{itemize}
    \item Concentrate on making this assertion and only this assertion in a succinct set of 1 to 3 paragraphs
    \item A common mistake is to explain too much of the problem context first. Instead, state the problem essentially as a claim, and leave explanations supporting your claim to the next part, “Why it is not already solved.”
\end{itemize}

Why the problem is not already solved or other solutions are ineffective in one or more important ways
\begin{itemize}

\item Your new idea need not solve every problem but it should solve at least one that is not already solved
\item This is the place to provide a succinct description of the problem context giving enough information to support the claim that a problem exists, made in the preceding problem declaration.
  
\end{itemize}

Why our solution is worth considering and why is it effective in some way that others are not

\begin{itemize}
\item A succinct statement of why the reader should care enough to read the rest of the paper.
\item This should include a statement about the characteristics of your solution to the problem which 1) make it a solution, and 2) make it superior to other solutions to the same problem.
\end{itemize}

How the rest of the paper is structured
\begin{itemize}
    \item The short statement below is often all you need, but you should change it when your paper has a different structure, or when more information is required to describe what a given section contains. If it isn’t required then you don’t want to say it here.
\end{itemize}

The rest of this paper first discusses related work in Section 2, and then describes our implementation in Section 3. Section 4 describes how we evaluated our system and presents the results. Section 5 presents our conclusions and describes future work.
