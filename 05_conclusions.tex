\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

The problem we have solved
\begin{itemize}
    \item The most succinct statement of the problem in the paper. Ideally one sentence. More realistically two or three. Remember that you simply state it without argument. If you have written a good paper you are simply reminding the reader of what they now believe and of how much they agree with you.
\end{itemize}

Our solution to the problem
\begin{itemize}
    \item Again, the succinct statement that you have presented a solution.
    \item Sometimes it works well to leave it at that and not even describe your
solution here. If you do, then again state your solution in one or two sentences taking the rhetorical stance that this is all obvious. If you have a good solution and have written an effective paper, then the reader already agrees with you.
\end{itemize}

Why our solution is worthwhile in some significant way
\begin{itemize}
    \item Again, a succinct restatement in just a few sentences of why your solution is worthwhile assuming the reader already agrees with you.
\end{itemize}
