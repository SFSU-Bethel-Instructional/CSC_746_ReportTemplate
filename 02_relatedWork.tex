Other efforts that exist to solve this problem and why are they less effective than our method
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resist the urge to point out only flaws in other work. Do your best to point out both the strengths and weaknesses to provide as well rounded a view of how your idea relates to other work as possible.
    \item In a social and political sense it is very smart as well as ethically superior to say good things, which are true, about other peopleâ€™s work. A major motivation for this is that editors and program committee members have to get a set of reviews for your paper. The easiest way for them to decide who should review it is to look at the set of references to related work (e.g., [1,2, 3]) to find people who are likely to be competent to review your paper. The people whose work you talk about are thus likely to be reading what you say about their work while deciding what to say about your work.
    \item  Clear enough? Speak the truth, say what you have to say, but be generous to the efforts of others.
\end{itemize}

Other efforts that exist to solve related problems that are relevant, how are they relevant, and why are they less effective than our solution for this problem.

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Many times no one has solved your exact problem before, but others have solved closely related problems or problems with aspects that are strongly analogous to aspects of your problem.
\end{itemize}
